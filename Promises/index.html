    <h1>Promises are cool</h1>
    <h3>A pattern for writing async code.</h3>
    <p>
      We call new promise function. This fuction have two parameters "resolve"
      and "reject" are the standars names. Went you call one of those parameters
      the promise is resolve, eather by being resolve or rejected.
    </p>
    <h3>How to run code if this promise was rejected or resolve.</h3>
    <p>This methods .then will run if our promise is resolve. Example:</p>
    <p>willGetYouADog.then(() => { console.log("YAY WE GOT A DOG!!!") })</p>
    <p>This methods .catch will run if our promise is rejected. Example:</p>
    <p>willGetYouADog.catch(() => { console.log("NO DOG!!!") });</p>
